# babylang

The language consisting of prints and ifs.

You can do this:

```
print 12;
```

Or this:

```
print e;
```

*In this case you will be asked to enter e*

Or even something like that:

```
if 3 + 8 > x then
  print 7;
end;
if 10e2 = 100 then print 100; else print -1;
```

Of course the values in variables must be numbers.

## Entering code

###### 1. in main function

In the place marked with the comment "write your code here"

###### 2. in file

run *(after you build the project)*:

```
./babylang myprog
```
